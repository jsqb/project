[Question 1]

A string S and two positive integers W and H are given.
S represents a name of shape, such as "Rectangle",
"Triangle". W and H represent the width (base) and
height of the shape, respectively.
The area of a rectangle whose sides are of length
W and H is W * H, and the area of a triangle whose
sides are of length W and H is W * H / 2.

Calculate the area of shape, and cut off your answer
after the decimal point, if necessary.
For example, given string S = "Rectangle" and integers
(W, H) = (3, 5) are:

W * H = 3 * 5 = 15

and given string S = "Triangle" and integers (W, H) =
(3, 5) are:

W * H / 2 = 3 * 5 / 2 = 7
Notice that the actual area is 7.5 but the answer needs
to be cut off after the decimal point.

Write a class:

class Solution1 { public int solution(String S, int W, int H); }

that, given a string S and two integers W and H,
returns the area of the shape. The method should
return -1 if string S is unknown name.
For example, given string S = "Rectangle" and integers
(W, H) = (3, 5), the method should return 15, as
explained above.

We have a plan to add some more area formulas, for
example, Oval, Rhombus. Your code should be designed
to minimize the impact of changes. More precisely,
new shapes should be able to be added without changing
the solution method.
Assume that:

S is a string containing a name of shape:
"Rectangle", "Triangle" or unknown name.

W and H are integers within the range [1..10,000].
